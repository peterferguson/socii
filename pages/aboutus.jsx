          Invest with Friends
        </h2>
        <p className="p-4 mx-auto">
          Socii's goal is to be the starting place for small groups of friends
          to begin, learn and refine their investing skills, together. Creating an investment group is hard. But it is probably one of the best and most fun ways of learning about
          investing.

        <p className="p-4 mx-auto">
          With the inception and raise in commision-free investing,
          there has been an influx in retail investors. Most without a clue of
          how to invest. My investment journey began with an initial solo
          learning phase followed by a desire to share this new found joy (and
          way to make money) with friends. 
          We looked at creating an investment club the traditional way - however
          it is riddles with hurdles. <br />
          Pooling investment clubs are dying. They mainly existed to avoid the
          high commission on trades for those who could not afford them. <br />
        </p>
        <p className="p-4 mx-auto">
          Enter commission free trading, where people no longer needed to join
          together to avoid this cost.
          Resulting in the loss of the fun of working together on the trades,
          counter arguments being risen against your investment thesis (which is
          much harder to do on your own), the visibility of holdings (and how
          well the portfolio has done if the individual has other holdings in
          the account), the learning together then also diminishes over time.
        </p>

        Socii is born out of a societal game of “keep-away” when it comes to
        keeping Investing away from the lower classes. We are here to even the
        odds. Bringing the ability to learn how to invest to the populous - with
        the ability to form small investment groups with your friends, you work
        as an active check and balance on each other with each trade you wish to
        pursue. The best way to learn to invest, is by investing with a group of
        people, and being forced to explain why you think that the next
        investment is the right one, opposed to just going ahead with a trade.
